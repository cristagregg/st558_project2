### Crista Gregg and Halid Kopanski  

This project analyzes the number of bicycle rentals from the Capital Bikeshare system over 2011 and 2012. We are attempting to predict the number of users by different variables such as weather type, temperature, humidity, etc. This will be done for each day of the week.   

This project requires the tidyverse, caret, knitr, and corrplot packages. 

You can find the link to each day's report below.
